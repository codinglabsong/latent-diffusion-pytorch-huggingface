# Ethical Considerations

## Data
- Uses the publicly available MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- Dataset contains minimal personal information and is intended for research use.

## Bias and Fairness
- Reflects the biases present in MNIST, such as style and digit frequency.
- Not suitable for applications requiring demographic fairness or sensitive decision making.

## Misuse and Security
- Generated samples may resemble training images; avoid using the model for authentication or security-critical systems.
- The model should not be applied to create deceptive, malicious, or sensitive content.

## Environmental Impact
- Training on MNIST requires modest compute resources; environmental impact is low.
- Scaling to larger datasets increases energy useâ€”consider efficient hardware and cloud regions.

## Responsible Use
- Provide attribution and document modifications when sharing derivatives.
- Evaluate societal impacts before applying the model to new domains.
